# .github
The `.github` repository in a GitHub organization is a special repository used for configuration and customization purposes. It allows organization-wide settings and templates that can be reused across multiple repositories within the organization. Here are the primary features and uses of the `.github` repository:

1. **Community Health Files**:
   - **README.md**: An optional file to provide information about the organization as a whole.
   - **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: Defines the expected behavior of contributors and maintainers.
   - **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for contributing to the repositories within the organization.
   - **SUPPORT.md**: Information on where to get help.
   - **SECURITY.md**: Instructions on how to report security vulnerabilities.

2. **Issue and Pull Request Templates**:
   - **ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**: A directory containing issue templates to standardize the reporting of bugs, feature requests, etc.
   - **PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md**: A template to standardize pull request descriptions.

3. **Funding Information**:
   - **FUNDING.yml**: Defines funding options to help support the project (e.g., links to Patreon, Open Collective, etc.).

4. **Workflow Templates**:
   - **workflow-templates/**: A directory to store reusable GitHub Actions workflow templates that can be used across repositories in the organization.

5. **Default Community Health Files**:
   - If a repository within the organization does not have its own community health files (like `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`), GitHub will use the ones in the `.github` repository by default.

### Example Structure of a .github Repository

```

### Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensures that all repositories in the organization follow the same guidelines and templates, leading to a more cohesive and professional approach.
- **Efficiency**: Saves time by avoiding the need to duplicate the same files in multiple repositories.
- **Governance**: Provides a central location to manage community health files and workflow templates, making it easier to update and maintain them.

By utilizing the `.github` repository, organizations can streamline their processes, maintain high standards across their projects, and provide clear guidelines and support for their contributors.
